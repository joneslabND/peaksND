R tool for processing of amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) data generated by ABI sequencers

This tool provides a graphical user interface for extracting, size calling, and binning AFLP data. The tool 
uses the package 'rpanel' to generate the GUI and a number of custom functions for peak finding and baseline
determination.
